# Notes

## @Data annotation from Lombok

- In Lombok, the @Data annotation is a shorthand that combines several other annotations to make your code more concise and less boilerplate. When you use @Data, it automatically generates:

- @Getter: Generates getter methods for all fields.
- @Setter: Generates setter methods for all fields.
- @ToString: Generates a toString() method.
- @EqualsAndHashCode: Generates equals() and hashCode() methods.
- @RequiredArgsConstructor: Generates a constructor for all final fields and fields that are marked with @NonNull.
